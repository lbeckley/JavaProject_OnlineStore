This is my project for Code Louisville May 2020 JavaScript.

I chose to use my May 2017 FEWD project, a redesign of an existing website, and add JavaScript enhancements. The original website can be viewed at the following link: http://www.modernroots.org/store/c1/Featured_Products.html.

Features Included:

On "Join" page:
1) Create a form and save the response (on click of Submit button) to an external file or API
2) Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format

On "Home" page:
3) Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
