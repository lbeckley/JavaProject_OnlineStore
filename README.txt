This is my project for Code Louisville May 2020 JavaScript.

I chose to use my May 2017 FEWD project, a redesign of an existing website, and add JavaScript enhancements. The original website can be viewed at the following link: http://www.modernroots.org/store/c1/Featured_Products.html.

The purpose of the redesign is to give her online presence a fresher, more appealing look and feel, as her products are great, but her website is not so great!
